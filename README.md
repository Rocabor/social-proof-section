## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework




### What I learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to solidify my understanding of layout techniques. I focused on creating a responsive design that adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop views.

One of the key challenges was positioning the rating cards and testimonials with staggered offsets on larger screens. I used Tailwind's utility classes like `xl:self-center` and `xl:self-end` to achieve this effect cleanly without writing custom CSS.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to explore more complex grid layouts and focus on perfecting pixel-perfect implementations from design files. I also plan to delve deeper into advanced TailwindCSS techniques.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The official documentation is incredibly comprehensive.


### AI Collaboration

Describe how you used AI tools (if any) during this project. This helps demonstrate your ability to work effectively with AI assistants.

- What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot)?
- How did you use them (e.g., debugging, generating boilerplate, brainstorming solutions)?
- What worked well? What didn't?
